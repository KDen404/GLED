A little side Project (Thats how everything ever started) to provide a starting point for 2D/3D game Engine development. Could also be used for any other type of 2D/3D development.
Although it would make much more sense to make an Engine out of it as an abstraction layer.

Proposed workflow for other projects using this as a base:
please build a driver layer on top of it just encapsulate the given public functions using pointers so you know if something broke when you updated and i deprecated something without telliing anyone or refactored a given function name.

FORBIDDEN USE CASES:
- Development for military services of any kind
- Development of malware/ransomware

Allowed use case:
although malicious use is forbidden. White Hat use is allowed, therefore if you want to provide an opengl interface for a pen testing application, go for it as long as your application is mentioning this repository, linking towards it and is publicly available.
If your application is not intended of murdering or harming people intentionally (i.e. weapon systems interfaces, ransomware) you are most likely good to go.


If you use my code or the project in your application you agree that i may not be sued because of code written in this repository. 
If your application that uses parts or my entire code base harms another person, animal or any infrastructure in public or private domain i am not responsible. You are responsible for your own causes.
